v0.1 harvester looks for key words "peer from" in syslog to create a new Session.

The custom version of pptpd somehow does not procude this keywords when connected.

This actually provides a way to migrate to the custom version, as the old harvester can only harvest to the point of the custom pptpd.

v1.0 harvester will start from the log in /var/log/pptpd/monitor.log. So there is no overlap.
